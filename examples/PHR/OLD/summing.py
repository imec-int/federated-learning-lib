    Class for iterative averaging based fusion algorithms.
    An iterative fusion algorithm here referred to a fusion algorithm that
    sends out queries at each global round to registered parties for
    information, and use the collected information from parties to update
    the global model.
    The type of queries sent out at each round is the same. For example,
    at each round, the aggregator send out a query to request local model's
    weights after parties local training ends.
    The iterative algorithms can be terminated at any global rounds.

    In this class, the aggregator requests local model's weights from all
    parties at each round, and the averaging aggregation is performed over
    collected model weights. The global model's weights then are updated by
    the mean of all collected local models' weights.
